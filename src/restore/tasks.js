/**
 * Restore terminals without a VSCode extension.
 *
 * VSCode natively runs tasks when a folder opens, via
 * runOptions.runOn = "folderOpen", and gives each task its own terminal panel.
 * So restoring is just writing a tasks.json: open the folder and VSCode itself
 * spawns the terminals and resumes every chat. No extension, no AppleScript, no
 * driving the UI from outside.
 *
 * Two gates decide whether those tasks ever run, and both fail silently. This
 * was verified by experiment, not assumption: a probe task in an untrusted
 * folder never fired, the same probe in a trusted folder fired in 4 seconds.
 *
 *   1. "task.allowAutomaticTasks" must be "on" in USER settings. VSCode's own
 *      schema marks it scope 1 (APPLICATION), like update.mode, so a workspace
 *      .vscode/settings.json copy is read by nobody. This module used to write
 *      exactly that and report success. See restore/vscode-settings.js.
 *   2. The folder must be trusted. VSCode's RunAutomaticTasks returns before it
 *      even inspects the setting when isWorkspaceTrusted() is false, so a fresh
 *      folder does nothing at all until you answer the trust prompt.
 *
 * A third, and the awkward one: VSCode does not reliably run several tasks that
 * start together. Since 1.70 multiple runOn folderOpen tasks do not all fire
 * (microsoft/vscode#160013), and a dependsOn parent did not help either.
 * Measured on four tasks, only presentation.group ran all of them:
 *
 *   shared group                4 of 4
 *   no group, dedicated panel   1 of 4
 *   dependsOn + dedicated       1 of 4
 *   dependsOn + panel "new"     0 of 4
 *
 * So tasks share a group. VSCode presents grouped tasks as split panes rather
 * than tabs, which is a real cost, but silently restoring one chat out of four
 * is a worse one. The panes can be rearranged by hand afterwards.
 *
 * dependsOn is not used: combined with grouping it measured 0 of 4.
 *
 * Starts are staggered with a leading sleep so a dozen terminals do not launch
 * in the same instant.
